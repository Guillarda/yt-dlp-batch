# yt-dlp-batch
I made this batch file for simplify the use of yt-dlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on Windows system

The script will automatically download ffmpeg and yt-dlp but if you already have them installed on your computer, the script will use them.

For use the script just run it and past the link of your video (The script will download only audio) or playlist
